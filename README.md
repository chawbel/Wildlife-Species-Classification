**Classifying African Wildlife Using Camera Trap Images and Deep Learning**

## Project Overview  
This project uses a **ResNet50-based CNN** to classify species (e.g., Impala, Zebra) from camera trap images. The goal is to support biodiversity conservation efforts by automating wildlife monitoring. The model was trained on 1,500+ images from OpenMV and Raspberry Pi cameras and achieves **91% accuracy**.

## Dataset  
### Source  
- **Mendeley Camera Trap Dataset**:  
  [Dataset Link](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/6mhrhn7rxc/1)  
  - Contains images from **OpenMV** and **Raspberry Pi** cameras.  
  - Labels include species, count, and geospatial coordinates.  

### Preprocessing  
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Split multi-species entries into separate rows (e.g., `IMPALA, ZEBRA` â†’ two entries).  
   - Removed corrupted/truncated images.  
2. **Folder Structure**:  
   Organized images into species-specific folders (e.g., `dataset/train/IMPALA/`).  
3. **Handling Nested Folders**:  
   Located Raspberry Pi images across 30 deployment subfolders (e.g., `1st-deployment`).
